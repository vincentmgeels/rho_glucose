## Questions

**Data**
- why are the data missing?
- more details about the study and dataset?
- any background knowledge we should be aware of?
- where can we obtain the data?

**Problem Statement**
- what are the hypotheses of interest?
- comparing devices or treatments?
- if comparing devices, is there paired data?
- estimation versus hypothesis testing?

**Methods**
- do we need to stick with statistical models, or can we try other methods such as machine learning?
- to answer the questions of interest, do you prefer one more or multiple models?
- how to handle the fact that different people may eat meals at different times of the day?
- how do we want to deal with the missing data? (is it okay if we leave these values out at first?)
- can you tell us a bit more about GAMMs and FDA and why you think they will be helpful methods for this problem?
- how many methods would you like us to try?
- do you have suggestions for how to assess the model - possibly leaving out a test data and possibly cross validation
- varying coefficient models?
- hypothesis testing with FDA?

**Practical**
- is it okay if we use R?
- latex vs R markdown for report?
- can you share the slides from the talk?
